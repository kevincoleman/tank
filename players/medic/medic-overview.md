The medic is responsible for keeping everyone on the team in good health. This can be achieved by administering field dressings, medicine, and temporary rest orders. The medic can also choose to improve the whole team's health by promoting mental health activities when no hostiles are present. He can occasionally help improve morale, but is mostly in charge of individual team members' health.
