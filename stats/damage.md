0-20 Damage is a scale of zero to twenty (starting at zero). Throughout most missions the tank will take physical damage and/or have mechanical issues. These could come from a variety of factors: taking fire, running into hazards, neglecting maintenance, &c. Taking damage affects maneuverability, and can also injure team members. It's everyone's responsibility to avoid damage, and the mechanic can repair damage.
